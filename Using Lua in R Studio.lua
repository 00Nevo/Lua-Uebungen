can i use lua like that in r studio to do any of the stuff that R normally does?
ChatGPT:

Awesome question ‚Äî and the short answer is:
üî∏ Yes, you can use Lua inside RStudio with luajr,

but... Lua won‚Äôt replace R ‚Äî it can complement it for certain tasks.
üí° Think of it like this:

    R is a high-level language built for statistics, modeling, and visualization.

    Lua is a lightweight scripting language, good for embedding logic, handling loops, working with config files, or doing quick procedural scripting.

‚úÖ What you can do with Lua in R:

Using the luajr package, you can:
‚úÖ	Example
Run Lua code from R	lua("x = 5 + 10")
Get Lua values back to R	lua("return x")
Pass R values into Lua	lua_assign("myval", 42)
Run small Lua scripts from R	e.g. procedural loops or conditionals
Use Lua as a "lightweight helper" inside R projects	For example: game logic, simple rules, simulations
üî• But you cannot (and shouldn't try to) use Lua for:

    Plotting graphs (ggplot2)

    Modeling / stats (like lm, glm, or machine learning)

    Data frames / tidyverse-style workflows

    Packages like dplyr, caret, shiny, etc.

R is designed for that, and Lua doesn‚Äôt have the libraries or ecosystem.
üõ†Ô∏è Use cases where Lua can be helpful in R:

    Embedding Lua logic into a simulation system

    Creating a lightweight rules engine inside R (e.g. game-like decision logic)

    Reading or writing config files using Lua syntax

    Teaching or prototyping scripting concepts in a different style than R

    Working with other systems (games, embedded systems) that already use Lua

üß™ Tiny demo: Mixing R and Lua

library(luajr)

# Assign from R to Lua
lua_assign("r_val", 12)

# Lua code using that value
lua("result = r_val * 3.14")

# Get result back into R
res <- lua("return result")
print(res)  # Should print 37.68

üß† TL;DR

    You can embed Lua logic in R ‚Äî think of it as scripting within R.

    You can pass values back and forth between R and Lua.

    But Lua won‚Äôt replace R‚Äôs core data science capabilities ‚Äî it‚Äôs more like a helper tool.
